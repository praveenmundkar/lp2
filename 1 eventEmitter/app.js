// In the example below we have created a function that will be executed when a "scream" event is fired.
// To fire an event, use the emit() method.
var events = require("events");
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();

//Create an event handler:
var myEventHandler = function () {
  console.log("I hear a scream!");
};

//Assign the event handler to an event:
eventEmitter.on("scream", myEventHandler);

//Fire the 'scream' event:
eventEmitter.emit("scream");

//for output open terminal and type command : node app.js
